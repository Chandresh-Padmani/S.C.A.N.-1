  <p>
      4. There are 2 methods to run an application in Android Studio. You can either set up a virtual device for development (Google Pixel 2, in my case) or hook up a mobile              device instead.
      <br />
      5. In the 2nd bar from the top, there there is a 'Run app' option. Alternatively, you can use Shift + F10 to run the project.
