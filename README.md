      The issue of time consumption during analytics is paramount in any organisation, especially after a successful project. Therefore, we intend to aid in analytics by               bringing an android application for quick calculation and study of the result. One simply has to choose the formula, enter their input elements and gather an output. There       are two kinds of formulas, ones which have a graphical output and others which have a numerical output. In formulas having a graphical output, the user has to enter             multiple elements (up to a certain limit). The graphs are user-friendly and flexible. In formulas having a numerical output, the user has to enter standard formula               elements. There are formula descriptions for ease of use.

      Upon selecting a module, a list of formulas that come under that module are shown. The user can then select the particular formula that they want to use.

      Upon selecting a formula, an input screen opens. It is customised according to whether the formula excepts a list of values, a set of fixed variables, etc. The user needs       to enter the formula input values here.

      Upon entering the inputs, the formula will process them and the output is shown. The format of the output may be a line-chart, a pie-chart, a bar-chart, or simply the           numerical answer.

      Here, the user can perform their analytics and make proper suppositions.
      <br /> <br />
      For uninformed users, there are descriptions of how to read the output.

  <p align='justify'>
      4. There are 2 methods to run an application in Android Studio. You can either set up a virtual device for development (Google Pixel 2, in my case) or hook up a mobile              device instead.
      <br />
      5. In the 2nd bar from the top, there there is a 'Run app' option. Alternatively, you can use Shift + F10 to run the project.
